# pytorch-paligemma

A Multimodal (Vision) Language Model from scratch using only Python and PyTorch. 

the PaliGemma Vision Language Model from scratch while explaining all the concepts behind it:
- Transformer model (Embeddings, Positional Encoding, Multi-Head Attention, Feed Forward Layer, Logits, Softmax)
- Vision Transformer model
- Contrastive learning (CLIP, SigLip)
- Numerical stability of the Softmax and the Cross Entropy Loss
- Rotary Positional Embedding
- Multi-Head Attention
- Grouped Query Attention
- Normalization layers (Batch, Layer and RMS)
- KV-Cache (prefilling and token generation)
- Attention masks (causal and non-causal)
- Weight tying
- Top-P Sampling and Temperature
